## **Tweet Cyberbullying**
In this project, I did text categorization using the Deep Neural Network model, this model was created to classify cyberbullying tweets spread on Twitter. The objective I want is for this model to be able to classify properly, so that the tweets fall into the correct class.

1. Create a model for classifying text about Cyberbullying Tweets
2. Experiment with 3 model algorithms namely LSTM, DNN and GRU
3. Using Metrics Recall to measure and reduce False Negative.
4. Libraries used by Pandas, Tensorflow, Numpy, NLTK, WordCloud
